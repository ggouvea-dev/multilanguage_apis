# multilanguage_apis
A set of API's builded with different languages

## Why?

I really think that learning new languages worth to improve the way we think while working with our "primarily" languages. 
Somestimes it is good to exit the confort zone and think in different approats to solve the same problem.
And the most important reason is: It will be fun :)

## What will be builted

The API should serve the same resources, iniatially only Products, and if I have enougth spread time I will be improving the API's.
For database I will be using SQLite since it is very simple an probably all languages can handle it out of the box. It should be possible to have a simple CRUD


The way I'am doing is:
1. Looking at the official documentation of the language/framework.
2. Watching/Reading some tutorials only if I get stucked.

Probrably this will become a blog post to share how the process was for each language/framework.

## My current language

Rigth now I'am working primarily with Java (about 3-4 years) with VRaptor (RIP) and Spring Boot, and Dart ( 1 year ) with Flutter but I have to confess that
always I can I play around with Dart without Flutter just becouse I really enjoyed the Dart lan, and, offcourse, a litle of JavaScript
since one of the Java software I work on is a monolith web ERP.
